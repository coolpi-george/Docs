## Login steps
- Connect the power and plug in the network cable
    -   The power supply range is 9V-36V, with the positive terminal near the USB end. <br>Note: Incorrect polarity can cause damage to the machine.
        <div align=center>  <img src=".\image\power.png" width=40%></div>

    -   The default network connection method of the machine is DHCP to automatically obtain an IP address.<br> 
        After the network is connected normally, the two indicator lights on the network port will light up simultaneously.
- Obtain the IP address of the machine<br>
    -   Use LAN IP address scanning software [Advanced_IP_Scanner](https://download.advanced-ip-scanner.com/download/files/Advanced_IP_Scanner_2.5.4594.1.exe) to obtain all scanned LAN IP addresses.
    -   After downloading and installing the software, open the software and you will see the following interface. Click Scan to start scanning.The IP address corresponding to the "CP3B" device is the actual IP address of the machine.


        <div align=center>  <img src=".\image\image-2.png" width=50%></div>

    -   The machine with the device name CP3B in the scanning results corresponds to the DHCP address of the machine.

- Login device<br>
    -   Enter the following link in the browser to enter the login interface:<br>
        https://your_ipaddress:9090/<br>  
    -   Replace "your_ipaddress" with the actual IP address of the machine. such as "https://172.16.19.111:9090".<br>  
        <div align=center>  <img src=".\image\image-5.png" width=50%></div>

    -   Enter your username and password, then click login.<br> The default username for the machine is "admin", and the password is "admin".
        <div align=center>  <img src=".\image\image-6.png" width=50%></div>

    -   Click on the terminal to enter the shell interface, where you can update various devices of the system or operating system.
        <div align=center>  <img src=".\image\image-8.png" width=50%></div>

    -   You can also log in using the console interface
        <div align=center>  <img src=".\image\console.png" width=50%></div>   

    -   The console is a USB to serial chip CH340, and the driver needs to be [Download](https://www.wch.cn/download/file?id=65) and installed before use.
  
    -   The default baud rate for console serial port is 115200.
## Interface operation
- Interface
   <div align=center>  <img src=".\image\port.png" width=50%></div>

    -   The correspondence between ttySx device nodes and interfaces.
        
        spidev0.0 -- TBUS //Extended I/O Module Communication Interface

        ttyS1 -- RS485-1 (A1 B1)

        ttyS7 -- RS485-2 (A2 B2)

        ttyS9 -- RS485-3 (A3 B3)

        ttyS5 -- RS232   (T1 R1)

        ttyS3 -- UART-TTL(5V) (IO0 IO1) //These two pins can be configured for UART(default) 、GPIO and I2C functions.

        ttyUSB0-ttyUSB3 -- 4G-LTE

    -   RS485&RS232

        ```
        stty -F /dev/ttyS1 raw speed 115200 //Configure RS485 baud rate to 115200
        echo "hello world" > /dev/ttyS1     //Send "hello world" to RS485 port
        ```
        - You can also operate the serial port through C or Python.
    -   4G-LTE 

        - The dialing script is located in the following directory:
            ```
            /etc/ppp/quectel-pppd.sh
            ```
        - Operators in different regions need to configure APN, username, and password, which can be directly modified in the following location in the dialing script:
        <div align=center>  <img src=".\image\ppp.png" width=50%></div>

        - You can obtain APN ，username and password from different operators through the following connections. 

            [https://bigfun.tripod.co.uk/](https://bigfun.tripod.co.uk/)


        - Inserting the 4G module and SIM card,Correctly configure APN username and password, the machine will automatically complete the dialing operation after booting up. 
        
        - After successful dialing, the system will display the following ppp0 network nodes.

        - The default 4G-LET module model currently used is EC20.
        <div align=center>  <img src=".\image\image-10.png" width=50%></div>

    -   WIFI/BT
        - The default WIFI module model used by the machine is BL-M8800DU6-D80, which uses the AIC8800D80 chip. Support wifi 802.11a/b/g/n/ac/ax and bt5.4.<br>
        - The system has already integrated drivers and firmware by default, and can be used by plugging in the module.

        As shown in the following figure, new users can be added and permissions can be configured through the backend management software.
        <div align=center>  <img src=".\image\image-9.png" width=50%></div>
  -  How to connect to WiFi network？
        ```
        /*Find available WiFi networks*/
        nmcli dev wifi list
        /*To connect to a WiFi network, you need to replace<SSID>with the network name you want to connect to, and<password>with the password for that network:*/
        nmcli --ask dev wifi connect <SSID> password <password> 
        ```
  -  Unable to register for 4G network?
        
        Pay attention to the insertion direction of the SIM card as shown in the figure below, with the notch facing outward.
        <div align=center>  <img src=".\image\sim.png" width=50%></div>
  -  How to modify the startup image?
        - Modify the content of the attached image and copy it to the /boot/firmware directory of the machine.
        - Be sure not to change the file name and format (BMP).
        <div align=center>  <img src=".\image\logo.bmp" width=50%></div>
        <div align=center>  <img src=".\image\logo_kernel.bmp" width=50%></div>
  -  How to backup an image?
        - Copy the script shown in the figure to a USB drive, insert the USB drive into the machine, and then execute the script with administrator privileges in the background, waiting for the backup to complete.
        - Note that the space on the USB flash drive must be greater than twice the size of the machine's root partition.
        - Replace the Ubuntu * * *. img file in the Image directory of the burning tool with the generated image, and burn it for testing on a new machine.
